  # Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

    Answer: (1) That Express is a javascript, web applications framework for Node.js that helps developers organize their application (makes it easier to implement CRUD). (2) That Express is middleware (framework) that enables developers to create routes through function calls. BONUS: Express is unopinionated.

    # Describe Middleware?

    Answer: Middleware is actually software. It is a layer between, or a bridge/translator if you will, between two applications that are otherwise unrelated and aides communication between the two (data flow).

    # Describe a Resource?

    Answer: A 'resource' is bits of data (for example name, age etc...) that can be accessed via the front-end if the requestor has the right access.

     # What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

    Answer: A successful request would return a status code of 200 - 'Everything is ok'.

    # How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

    Answer: We can partition our application by using 'express.Router()', which allows us to streamline our code by taking away the clutter, if you will, making it concise, readable, and clean.
